This repository contains a general voting contract designed to be the community polling counterpart to [ds-chief](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-chief)

## Scheme

A running tally for each individual poll is not kept on-chain. Instead, voters' addresses and votes are registered, and the token-weighted tallying is done and verified off-chain
